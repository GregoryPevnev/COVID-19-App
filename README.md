# COVID-19 application

## About

A volunteering application suited specifically for getting and providing help during the COVID-19 pandemic. The application allows volunteers to find those who need help, such as senior citizens, handicapped people and anyone else, connecting the two together.

In addition to that, the application provides an extensive list of guides related to the pandemic, enabling users to search, rate and edit them similar to Wikipidea articles.

Finally, the app also reports real-time statistics regarding the COVID-19 cases in various areas of Canada.

## Top 5 New Desirable Features

1. Automatically showing statistics from the user’s specific region based on their current location (retrieved from the geolocation service).

2. Allowing volunteers to set preferences regarding what kind of requests they are going to be receiving when searching their local area (Not showing any requests that ask for medical help / prioritizing food delivery).

3. Integrating the application with various messengers for communicating through them when calling and receiving calls (Specifying which one to use / Using regular phone calls and text messages).

4. Connecting volunteers’ profiles to their external resumes / volunteering history records and updating them according to their accomplishments and activity they performed through the application.

5. Integrating the guides with various corresponding wikipedia articles and health organization articles so that any changes made on the either side are reflected (When a guide is edited in the application the changes are shown outside and vice-versa).

### Help

Depending on whether the user is someone who gives help or asks for help, the application is either going to allow them to search for help requests in their area or enable them to fill out a request for help.

Alternatively, handicapped can also reach the call-center via a phone call in order to have their request details filled out for them.

In addition to that, elderly people can also contact certain volunteers in their area directly if they publish their contact information.
